 * General Problems - Exercise 1:
 * Write a program that, given a string read from the keyboard, checks if it is a palindrome (a special
 * word which reads the same, whether one starts from the left and moves to the right, or the other way
 * around).
 * Suggestion â€“ Build your solution using a FIFO and a stack.
